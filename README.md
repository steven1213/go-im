# go-im

This project aims to implement a comprehensive IM system, which is not without the component of re-inventing the wheel, 
but as a GoLang beginner, I hope to learn the various features of GoLang through this project, and at the same time I hope to help other beginners.


In the process of implementation, I will use AIGC (ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc.) to help me implement some functions,
and strive to implement a high-quality IM system.

go-im will adopt a microservice architecture to implement the various functional modules of the IM system, such as user management, message management, group management, friend management, permission management, group, robot, etc.
